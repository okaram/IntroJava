Succeeding in this class
===

This class is planned so that, even if you've never programmed before, you will succeed and become a (beginner) programmer; of course, any experience with programming and things that are like programming (html development, writing bat files, using the command line a lot in a Unix system) will help.

## Time requirements

This is a 3-credit hour graduate class; traditionally, this would mean we meet for 3 hours per week, and you should putting another 3 hours outside the classrom for each hour inside, for a total of 12 hours per week; this may go a little up or down depending on your previous programming experience and other things, including whether you're taking the class online (I've always found online classes harder, but everybody is different), so plan on spending twelve to maybe fifteen hours per week. 


## Succeeding in the class

+ **put the time** - see time requirements above; think whether you realistically have the time available (you just got yourself an extra part-time job :)
+ **start early** that way, you can find out whether you need to spend more time, or you can ask for help and get it, so you don't fall behind. Many times your programs will be 'almost done' for a while, so make sure they are 'done done' as early as possible.
+ **don't fall behind** - if you notice you're missing a concept, ask for help as soon as possible, don't wait for a week or two to pass; we build on early concepts, so you can't just skip a topic and hope never to see it again
+ **ask for help** if and when you need it; we will have discussion groups where you can ask; also, ask the teacher directly, either by email or with comments on your pull request.
+ **embrace the technology** make sure you can use the technology; if your computer gets misconfigured, fix it before continuing; although code is text, and you could do it in any system, we have built a lot of scaffolding to help you.
+ **embrace unit tests** in particular; use unit tests to guide your assignments; run them often, as they give you immediate feedback; if you can't run them, fix it first, rather than trying to program blind.
+ **embrace code reviews** - You will be sending your code for me to check, and I can make detailed comments on each line if needed; feel free to send an incomplete pull-request, and add comments asking question; that way you can get unstuck easily.
+ Use the assignments wisely - The assignments are designed to help you learn; if you have a tutor or somebody helping you, don't have them help you solve the assignments; go over the material, or maybe solve similar problems together, but make sure you solve the assignments yourself.
