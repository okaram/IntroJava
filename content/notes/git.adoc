= Version control and git

When we write code, we are doing changes constantly; in programming, we figured out ways to name the changes and make them explicit; we call this *version control*. You will be using version control throughout your career, so you may want to make sure you learn it well.

There are many version control systems; We will use `git`, one of the most popular ones.


== Terminology
- *commit* - A set of changes to a set of files.
- *repository* - (commonly abbreviated as repo) a set of files and folders, with all their history of changes.
- *local repository* - a folder on the local machine, which also contains the history of changes to all files in that folder
- *remore repository* - a git repository that is not stored on the local machine

== Basic concepts

In your machine, you keep your files in a folder, with some metadata, which makes it a *repository* (the metadata is stored in a folder called `.git`, in case you care).

You make changes to those files, usually with a text editor, or IDE (or maybe by creating folders, or creating empty files, or using some other commands). At any time, you can see which files you've changed by running `git status`.

Once you have a set of changes you like, you need to *commit* them into your local repo. When you create a commit, you need to provide a comment, which works like a title for the commit (most times, you want to use a meaningful comment, so you can later remember what you did).

To allow for extra flexibility when committing, git first requires you to *stage* your changes; so committing is usually a two-step process.

1. Use `git add` to stage some files (or the changes to them)
2. Use `git commit` to commit those changes, adding a comment to them. Notice this creates a logical grouping of the changes.

To allow for sharing your changes (and also as a backup), you want to have more than one copy of your repository; that is, you want to have one or more *remote repositories* (we will use gitlab.com to keep our remote repos; I create a shared remote repo for each student; shared between you and me). You use `git push` to push the changes to a remote repository.
