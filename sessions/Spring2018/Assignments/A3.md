Assignment 3

# Instructions

Open the a3 project in IntelliJ, and modify the file in src/main/java/assignment/Assignment3.java (and any other files in that folder, according to the instructions) so it complies with the instructions. 

Use `./gradlew test` and the files in src/test/features to guide your testing, making sure you eventually pass all unit tests.
